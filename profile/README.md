# Welcome to Compose-X!

The projects we work on aim to 

* Help developers/SRE/Cloud engineers to deploy applications to AWS
* Add AWS CloudFormation integrations to build better IaC
* Provide guidance, blogs, tutorials, to implement best practices in applications development

See our examples and walkthroughs in the [Labs](https://labs.compose-x.io) and visit our [Blog](https://blog.compose-x.io).

# Welcome to Compose-X!

### Origins

Compose-X was created as a GitHub "organization" to group repositories used for the ecosystem and projects around
[ECS Compose-X](https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex) and generally to share on AWS experience arount deployment
of services to ECS, going from CICD to monitoring and long-term maintenance.

Using AWS Services such as AWS CloudFormation, you will find here what we hope to be helpful to your journey into
adoption of AWS and its best practices.

As we have evolved with customer or work use-cases, the scope of the eco-system has expanded to other projects, a lot
of which around Apache Kafka (and Confluent Cloud).
